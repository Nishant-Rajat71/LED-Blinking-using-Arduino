🟢 Arduino LED Blinking Project

📘 Overview

This project demonstrates a simple LED blinking program using an Arduino Uno.
The goal is to toggle an LED connected to digital pin 13 at regular intervals, showcasing basic GPIO control, timing functions, and Arduino IDE workflow.

⚙️ Hardware Requirements:

Arduino Uno (or compatible board)

1 × LED (any color)

1 × 220Ω resistor

Jumper wires

Breadboard

Circuit Summary:
Connect the LED’s positive terminal (anode) to pin 13 via a resistor, and the negative terminal (cathode) to GND.
